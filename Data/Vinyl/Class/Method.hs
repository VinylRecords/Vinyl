{-| This module uses 'RecAll' to extend common typeclass methods to records.
    Generally, it is preferable to use the original typeclass methods to these
    variants. For example, in most places where 'recCompare' could be used,
    you could use 'compare' instead. They are useful in scenarios
    that involve working on unknown subsets of a record's fields
    because 'RecAll' constraints can easily be weakened. An example of this
    is given at the bottom of this page.

{- $example
    This module provides variants of typeclass methods that have
    a 'RecAll' constraint instead of the normal typeclass
    constraint. For example, a type-specialized 'compare' would
    look like this:

> compare :: Ord (Rec f rs) => Rec f rs -> Rec f rs -> Ordering

    The 'recCompare' function looks like this:

> recCompare :: RecAll f rs Ord => Rec f rs -> Rec f rs -> Ordering

    The only difference is the constraint. Let's look at a potential
    use case for these functions.

    Let's write a function that projects out a subrecord from two records and
    then compares those for equality. We can write this with
    the '<:' operator from @Data.Vinyl.Lens@ and the normal 'compare'
    function. We don't need 'recCompare':

> -- This needs ScopedTypeVariables
> projectAndCompare :: forall super sub f. (super <: sub, Ord (Rec f sub))
>                   => Proxy sub -> Rec f super -> Rec f super -> Ordering
> projectAndCompare _ a b = compare (rcast a :: Rec f sub) (rcast b :: Rec f sub)

    That works fine for the majority of use cases, and it is probably how you should
    write the function if it does everything you need. However, let's consider
    a somewhat more complicated case.

    What if the exact subrecord we were projecting couldn't be
    known at compile time? Assume that the end user was allowd to
    choose the fields on which he or she wanted to compare records.
    The @projectAndCompare@ function cannot handle this because of the
    @Ord (Rec f sub)@ constraint. Even if we amend the constraint to
    read @Ord (Rec f super)@ instead, we cannot use this information
    to recover the @Ord (Rec f sub)@ constraint that we need. Let's
    try another approach.

    We can use the following GADT to prove subsethood:

> data Sublist (super :: [k]) (sub :: [k]) where
>   SublistNil   :: Sublist '[]
>   SublistSuper :: Proxy r -> Sublist super sub -> Sublist (r ': super) sub
>   SublistBoth  :: Proxy r -> Sublist super sub -> Sublist (r ': super) (r ': sub)
>
> projectRec :: Sublist super sub -> Rec f super -> Rec f sub
> projectRec s r = case s of
>   SublistNil -> RNil
>   SublistBoth n snext -> case r of
>     rhead :& rtail -> rhead :& projectRec snext rtail
>   SublistSuper n snext -> case r of
>     rhead :& rtail -> projectRec snext rtail

    It is also possible to write a typeclass to generate @Sublist@s
    implicitly, but that is beyond the scope of this example. Let's
    now write a function to use @Sublist@ to weaken a 'RecAll'
    constraint:

> import Data.Vinyl.Core hiding (Dict)
> import Data.Constraint
>
> weakenRecAll :: Proxy f -> Proxy c -> Sublist super sub -> RecAll f super c :- RecAll f sub c
> weakenRecAll f c s = case s of
>   SublistNil -> Sub Dict
>   SublistSuper _ snext -> Sub $ case weakenRecAll f c snext of
>     Sub Dict -> Dict
>   SublistBoth _ snext -> Sub $ case weakenRecAll f c snext of
>     Sub Dict -> Dict

    Now we can write a different version of our original function:

> -- This needs ScopedTypeVariables
> projectAndCompare2 :: forall super sub f. (RecAll f super Ord)
>                    => Sublist super sub -> Rec f super -> Rec f super -> Ordering
> projectAndCompare2 s a b = case weakenRecAll (Proxy :: Proxy f) (Proxy :: Proxy Ord) s of
>   Sub Dict -> recCompare (projectRec s a) (projectRec s b)

    Notice that in this case, the 'Ord' constraint applies to the full set of fields
    and is then weakened to target a subset of them instead.
