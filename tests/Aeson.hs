-- | Demonstrate encoding a 'Rec' to JSON. Three approaches are shown:
-- the first utilizes 'ToJSON' instances for the record's
-- interpretation type constructor applied to each of its fields. This
-- has the advantage of being concise by virtue of re-using a lot of
-- existing pieces. The downside to relying on existing 'ToJSON'
-- instances is that they encode self-contained JSON values, when what
-- we want to do is construct a single JSON object encompassing each
-- record field as a named field of that JSON object. We can do this
-- by inspecting the JSON serialization of each field, and extracting
-- it as a key-value pair if it was serialized as a JSON object with a
-- single named field. This works, but means that the types do not
-- guarantee correctness (i.e., if a record field is serialized as a
-- 'Number', we won't be able to include it in the serialization of
-- the 'Rec').
--
-- The second approach uses a bit of @aeson@ internals to instead
-- serialize each 'Rec' field as a key-value pair with no additional
-- decoration. This should be faster as well as more tightly typed
-- since we do not need to undo any 'Value' wrapping of the individual
-- record fields.
--
-- The third approach uses aeson's built-in functions for working with
-- 'Generic'. This requires some post-processing to address precisely
-- the above problem: the function based on 'Generic' ends up
-- producing a self-contained 'Value' for each field of the
-- record. Specifically, each field becomes an 'Array' that is either
-- empty or contains an 'Object' with a single field as well as
-- another, nested, 'Array' for the rest of the record. We include
-- here a function to flatten that recursive structure into the
-- 'Object' shape we want.
