# 0.14.0
- Removed aput and alens from Data.Vinyl.ARec. They were used internally, but their type is unsound.

# 0.13.1
- GHC 9.0.1 support

# 0.13.0
- GHC 8.10.1 support fix. A fix for the previous attempt at 8.10 support involves a backwards incompatible change.

# 0.12.2

- GHC 8.10.1 support

# 0.12.0

- GHC 8.8.1 support. Class type signatures were changed to remove explicit kind variables. This is to simplify the use of `TypeApplications` which changed with GHC 8.8.1 to require explicit application to those kind variables. Leaving them out of the class definitions preserves existing usage of `TypeApplications`. Thanks to Justin Le (@mstksg).

# 0.11.0

- Changed the `Show` instance of `CoRec`
- Added the `corec` helper that specifically helps type inference when
  constructing `CoRec ElField` values.

# 0.10.0

- Changed the types of `Data.Vinyl.CoRec.onCoRec` and `Data.Vinyl.CoRec.onField`. This was pushing through the changes to drop the use of `Proxy` arguments, relying instead on `TypeApplications`. Also added `onCoRec1` and `onField` to work with functions relying on a single type class.

- Faster `asA` and `asA'`. These implementations utilize `unsafeCoerce` in their implementations after we have performed a runtime check that proves (to us) that the types match up. The old implementations are still available as `asASafe` and `asA'Safe`. While both implementations can run in constant time if the compiler optimizes everything successfully, the faster variants are a bit more than 3x faster in a trivial benchmark.

- Add a `Generic` instance for `Rec` and common functors.

- Add a variety of `ToJSON` implementations as a test case. One or all of these should probably exist as a separate package to avoid `vinyl` depending on `aeson`, but their content may be of interest.

# 0.9.2

- Add `runcurryX` for applying an uncurried function to a `Rec` passing through the `XRec` machinery to strip out syntactic noise.

# 0.9.0

- A new `SRec` type for constant time field access for records with densely packed `Storable` fields. Conversion from `Rec` is accomplished with `toSRec`, while `fromSRec` takes you back to `Rec`. Record updates are fairly slow compared to native Haskell records and even `Rec`, but reading a field is as fast as anything.

- Concise record construction syntax from tuples. Construct a `FieldRec` with `fieldRec (#x =: True, #y =: 'b')` and have the type inferred as `Rec ElField '[ '("x", Bool), '("y", Char) ]`. Or use `record` to build records of any functor. Thanks to @heptahedron on GitHub for prompting this feature, and @sboosali for thinking through various approaches.

- Optional concise record field lens syntax. This uses an orphan `IsLabel` instance for all function types, so will conflict with any other library that does the same. Thus it is entirely opt-in: to enable this syntax, you must explicitly `import Data.Vinyl.Syntax`. This enables the use of labels as lenses. For example, `myRec & #name %~ map toUpper` to apply `map toUpper` to the `#name` field of the record value `myRec`. This technique is thanks to Tikhon Jelvis who shared it on the Haskell-Cafe mailing list.

- Field lenses can now change the type of a record. Thanks to @heptahedron on GitHub for exploring this feature. Using the above-mentioned features, one might now write something like `myRec & #name %~ length` to produce a record whose `#name` field is the length of the`String` `#name` field of some record value, `myRec`.

- Changed the type of `=:=` again to work directly with `Label`s as this is the most convenient usage.

- Definitions in `Data.Vinyl.Core` are now consistently in terms of type classes. This permits inlining and specialization to a user's record types. In the case where the record type is known, call sites do not change. But for functions polymorphic in the record's fields, a constraint will be required. If those constraints are a nuisance, or compile times increase beyond comfort, users should use definitions from the `Data.Vinyl.Recursive` that are written in a recursive style (as in previous versions of the `vinyl` package), treating the record as a list of fields.

- Added `restrictCoRec` and `weakenCoRec` suggested by @ElvishJerricco

# 0.8.0

- Overhaul of `FieldRec`: records with named fields. We now take advantage of the `-XOverloadedLabels` extension to support referring to record fields by names such a `#myField`.

- A new `ARec` type for constant-time field access. You can convert a classic, HList-like `Rec` into an `ARec` with `toARec`, or back the other way with `fromARec`. An `ARec` uses an `Array` to store record fields, so the usual trade-offs between lists and arrays apply: lists are cheap to construct by adding an element to the head, but slow to access; it is expensive to modify the shape of an array, but element lookup is constant-time.

**Compatibility Break**: The operator `=:` for constructing a record with a single field has changed. That operation is now known as `=:=`, while `=:` is now used to construct an `ElField`. It was decided that single-field record construction was not a common use-case, so the shorter name could be used for the more common operation. Apologies for making the upgrade a bit bumpy.

# 0.7.0
- Simplified `match`
- Added `Data.Vinyl.Curry`

# 0.6.0

Added a `CoRec` (co-record) type constructed in the same style as the existing `Rec` type for records. A `CoRec` is an open sum type: a value of `CoRec [a,b,c]` is either an `a`, a `b`, *or* a `c`. In contrast a `Rec [a,b,c]` includes an `a`, a `b`, *and*, a `c`.

# 0.5.3

Added a concise `Show` instance for `Const`.

# 0.5.2

Ported the tutorial to haddocks (andrewthad)

# 0.5.1

Added utilities for working with the `FieldRec` type.

# 0.5

Vinyl 0.5 combines the generality of Vinyl 0.4 with the ease-of-use of previous
versions by eschewing the defunctionalized type families and just using plain
type constructors; Vinyl 0.4-style records can be recovered in most cases in a
modular manner without baking it into the fabric of Vinyl itself.

Also new in 0.5 is a unified lens-based approach to subtyping, coercion and
projection.

# 0.4

Vinyl 0.4 is a big departure from previous versions, in that it introduces a
universe encoding as a means to generalize the space of keys from strings to
any arbitrary space. This means that you can have closed universes for your
records.
